# johnisom.github.io #

This is a github.io site for myself to aid in the Capstone job search. I built
this from scratch, with the exception of `jQuery` and Tantek Celik's
Whitespace Reset.

If you wish to get in contact with me, shoot me an email at

## TODOS ##

- [x] Make the first “section” smaller to fit better on small screens.
- [x] Put the “chevrons” at the same position relative to their “section”.
- [x] Add a media query to remove the `aside` if the screen gets small enough.
- [x] Add a media query to make the 3 optional projects stack on top of each
      other if the screen gets small enough. Currently, they try to squeeze in
      and it doesn’t quite work out.
- [x] Per community suggestion, make the contrast between the sidebar icons
      and the dark blue background more apparent.
- [x] Make it so only the sidebar social icons are shown or only the footer,
      never both at the same time. It looks a bit weird.
